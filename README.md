# Intro to Responsive Media

## Learning Goals

- Describe responsive media
- Describe percent measurements

## Introduction

Media queries allow us to choose between certain styles based on the size of
the device. We can easily imagine a web page full of text breaking into
multiple columns on wide screens and reducing to a single screen on a phone.
But what about _media_ instead of text. How can we make sure that a photo of an
adorable kitten makes sense in a multi-column _and_ a single-column display?

> **NOTE:** We're going to talk about _media_ as in images or videos in this
> lesson. Don't confuse _media_ with _media queries_.

## Describe Responsive Layouts

To quote Bruce Lee:

> "You must be shapeless, formless, "like water". When you pour water in a
cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the
bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.  Water can drip
and it can crash. Become like water my friend."

With CSS, we can create _fluid_ content. Using percent (%) measurements on our
media's CSS allows them to fluidly fill the size of their container. In most
cases, our media is contained within the columns and rows of our layouts.

## Describe Percent Measurements

```css
img, form, input, table, video, audio, iframe {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

In this code snippet, we set our images, forms, inputs, tables, videos, audio
elements, and iframes all to expand `width: 100%;`. This sets them to be as
wide as the parent element they are inside of. Then, by setting  `max-width:
100%;`, we prevent them from getting any larger than their parent.

Using both these properties will ensure that they scale fluidly in all
browsers.  Having them fill their containers allows us to write fewer media
queries overall as they will squish and expand until we set a fixed size for
their parent elements.  This also allows us to focus on sizing the parent element
of the media content, which will often be a column of sibling elements.

Consider a website like [Instagram](https://instagram.com): each photo being displayed
to a user shares a 'column' of content - a username, the photo, likes, comments;
all fit into the width of a 'card' on the page. If the card shrinks or expands
in size, the photo will too. Users on different sized screens will see a web
page that is _slightly_ different, but at all sizes, the content looks good and
is nearly consistent.

## Conclusion

In order to scale content to fill a container, we can set our media's width
properties to `width: 100%; max-width: 100%;`. They'll have flexible, fluid
widths that will expand to the size of their parent in proportion. It will
resize to accommodate the device automatically in most cases. It keeps sites
accessible and the code more maintainable with fewer media queries.
